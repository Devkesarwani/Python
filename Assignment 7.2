# 7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, 
# then opens that file and reads through the file, 
# looking for lines of the form:
# X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
# Count these lines and extract the floating point values 
# from each of the lines and compute the average of 
# those values and produce an output as shown below.
# You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt 
# when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.

# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name
